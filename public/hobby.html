  I loved playing since i was like 10. I just thinking as a developer who sits
  <br />
  in his chair the whole day, We need to be outside more and just play <br />
  something. so i never stopped playing the game i love.

<h2>Anime</h2>

  Honestly, its a hit or a miss for so many people but for it just means why
  <br />
  more than that. people say it's cartoons but it hits so many deep points about
  <br />
  the real world its insane!
</p>
<h2>learning the Guitar</h2>
